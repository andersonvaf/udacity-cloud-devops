This project covers a (manual) deployment of a static website to AWS by performing the following steps:

 - Create a public S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket.
 - Configure the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies.
 - Speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.
 - Access your website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.

## Project 2 - Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation

This project covers the hands-on experience needed to build knowledge about infrastructure as code. The goal is to deploy an application (Apache Web Server), which the code code is obtained from an S3 Storage, and deploy it in the appropriate folder on the web server.

This project has two main parts:

 - Diagram: a diagram that represents the infrastructure to be created by means of a CloudFormation script.
 - Script (Template and Parameters): The CloudFormation code necessary to build the required infrasctructure on AWS.
